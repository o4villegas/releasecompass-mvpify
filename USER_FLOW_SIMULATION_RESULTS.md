# User Flow Simulation Results

## Requested Flow Steps & Current Status

### 1. Create New Project
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Evidence:** No project creation UI exists in the codebase
- **Missing:** No "New Project" button, no project initialization flow
- **Current Reality:** App loads directly into timeline view without project context

### 2. Select 'Album' Type
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Evidence:** Project types defined in `financial-engine.ts` but no UI to select them
- **Missing:** No project type selector dropdown/buttons
- **Current Reality:** Cannot choose between single/EP/album types

### 3. Set Release Date 6 Months from Now
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Evidence:** Timeline has hardcoded dates (now to +1 year)
- **Missing:** No release date picker, no project configuration UI
- **Current Reality:** Timeline always shows fixed 1-year period

### 4. Verify 18-Month Timeline Generates Automatically
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Evidence:** No milestone template system exists
- **Missing:** No predefined milestone templates for album projects
- **Current Reality:** Timeline starts empty, must manually create each milestone

### 5. Drag Mastering Milestone 2 Weeks Earlier
**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY WORKING**
- **Evidence:** Drag-and-drop is implemented in `timeline-cylinder.ts`
- **Working:** Can drag milestones if they exist
- **Problem:** No mastering milestone exists to drag (no templates)

### 6. Confirm Dependency Cascade Updates
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Evidence:** Dependencies field exists in data model but no logic to handle cascading
- **Missing:** No dependency management system
- **Current Reality:** Moving a milestone doesn't affect dependent milestones

### 7. Mark 3 Milestones Complete
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**
- **Evidence:** Status field can be changed to "completed" in milestone editor
- **Working:** Can click milestone, change status dropdown to "Completed", save
- **Current Reality:** Must do this one milestone at a time

### 8. Verify Financial Calculations Update in Real-Time
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**
- **Evidence:** `FinancialEngine.calculateFinancialSummary()` called on updates
- **Working:** Budget totals, risk score, and projections update when milestones change
- **Current Reality:** Shows in financial dashboard sidebar

### 9. Save Project
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Evidence:** No save/load project functionality
- **Missing:** No save button, no project management
- **Current Reality:** Changes are sent to server but no project persistence

### 10. Reload Page
**Status:** ✅ **CAN DO**
- **Evidence:** Browser refresh works
- **Working:** Page reloads without errors

### 11. Confirm State Persistence
**Status:** ❌ **FAILS**
- **Evidence:** State stored in Durable Objects but no project-level persistence
- **Missing:** No project ID, no user sessions, no localStorage backup
- **Current Reality:** Refreshing page loses all milestones

## Summary Statistics

**Fully Working:** 2/11 steps (18%)
**Partially Working:** 1/11 steps (9%)
**Not Implemented:** 8/11 steps (73%)

## Critical Missing Features

### MUST HAVE for Basic Flow:
1. **Project Creation/Selection UI**
   - New project button
   - Project type selector (single/EP/album)
   - Release date picker
   - Project naming

2. **Milestone Templates**
   - Predefined milestones for each project type
   - Auto-population on project creation
   - Industry-standard timeline spacing

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Link milestones as dependencies
   - Cascade date changes
   - Prevent constraint violations

4. **Project Persistence**
   - Save project to Durable Objects with unique ID
   - Load existing projects
   - User session management
   - localStorage fallback

5. **Timeline Configuration**
   - Set custom timeline start/end dates
   - 18-month timeline for album projects
   - Reverse calculation from release date

## What IS Working:

### Successfully Implemented:
1. **3D Timeline Visualization** - Renders correctly with cobe
2. **Manual Milestone Creation** - Double-click to add milestones
3. **Milestone Editing** - Click to edit details, budget, status
4. **Drag-and-Drop** - Can reposition milestones on timeline
5. **Financial Calculations** - Real-time budget and risk updates
6. **Risk Visualization** - Environmental effects based on risk level
7. **WebSocket Sync** - Multi-tab synchronization works

## Recommendations for MVP Completion

### Priority 1: Project Infrastructure (Required for all flows)
- Add project creation modal
- Implement project type selection
- Create project state management
- Add unique project IDs

### Priority 2: Milestone Templates (Core feature)
- Create JSON templates for single/EP/album
- Auto-populate on project creation
- Include standard industry milestones
- Set appropriate spacing and dependencies

### Priority 3: Persistence (User expectation)
- Store projects with unique IDs in Durable Objects
- Add load project functionality
- Implement localStorage backup
- Session management

### Priority 4: Dependency System (Advanced but in spec)
- Add dependency linking UI
- Implement cascade logic
- Add constraint validation
- Visual dependency lines

## Conclusion

The current implementation has a solid foundation with working 3D visualization, milestone manipulation, and financial calculations. However, it lacks the project management layer entirely, making it impossible to complete the requested user flow. The app functions more as a milestone visualization demo than a complete project planning tool.

To achieve the requested flow, approximately 60-70% more functionality needs to be implemented, primarily around project management, templates, and persistence.
